            <p>You just finished playing the last round in the game.</p>
            <p>In every game, there are at least {{Constants.base_rounds}} rounds. 
            After that, another round is played with a 50% probability. And after 
            that, yet another round is played with a 50% probability and so on.
            The random generator took this into account and determined a
            maximum length of {{num_rounds}} for your group. You just 
            finished with the {{round_str}} round and you can now claim your bonus</p>
            <p><strong>Please finish the survey to receive your completion fee
            and bonus.</strong> Your bonus is the number of points that you
            accumulated over all rounds, with 1 point worth $0.01.</p>
